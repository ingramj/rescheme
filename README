ReScheme - A second Scheme implementation
=========================================

  ReScheme is a "sequel" to my earlier Scheme interpreter, bs. Just as bs was
written while I was following Peter Michaux's Scheme From Scratch articles,
ReScheme will be following his upcoming Royal Scheme series.
  See the LICENSE file for copyright and licensing information.

Compilation and Usage
=====================

  If you don't have clang installed, change the first line of Makefile to
"CC = gcc", or whatever is appropriate. There aren't any external dependencies
so far.

    $ make
    $ ./rescheme
    > 123
    123
    > -9876
    -9876
    > +45
    45
    > #b1011
    11
    > #o0644
    420
    > #h-14bead

    $

Not much to it yet.
